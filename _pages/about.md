I am a PhD candidate at Rice CAAM.
My research interests include discrete optimization, graph theory, and mathematical foundations for machine learning.
I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Joey Huchette](http://www.joehuchette.com/).
Previously, I worked as a research intern on the clustering problem for interaction data at [RIKEN AIP](https://aip.riken.jp/), hosted by Dr. [Tiphaine Viard](https://tiphaineviard.com/).
I obtained a BEng degree from the Talented Program at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/elitech).
My undergraduate thesis studied the minimum dominating set problem in graph theory.

My research goal is to understand and develop principles from the discrete optimization point of view to applications in large-scale data science and machine learning.
Currently, I am working on Mixed-Integer Formulations for neural networks verification.
