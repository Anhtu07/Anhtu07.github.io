I am a graduate student at Rice CAAM in the Master/PhD track.
My research interests include discrete optimization, integer programming, polyhedral theory, and their applications for machine learning.
I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Joey Huchette](http://www.joehuchette.com/).
Previously, I worked as a research intern on the clustering problem for interaction data at [RIKEN AIP](https://aip.riken.jp/), hosted by Dr. [Tiphaine Viard](https://tiphaineviard.com/).
I obtained a BEng degree from the prestigious Talented Program (5 years) at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/elitech).
My undergraduate thesis studied the minimum dominating set problem in graph theory.

My research is motivated by solving real-world problems using discrete optimization techniques.
Currently, I am working on two projects: integer value function learning and mixed-integer formulations for neural networks verification.
